    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago my new laptop came in the mail: a ThinkPad E540. Mine is configured with a core i7, 16 GB ram, 16 GB SSD cache, a 1 TB HDD and a matte full HD screen.
It was a custom order via the lenovo webshop, so it took about three weeks to build and ship it.</p>

<h1>First impressions</h1>

<p>My first impressions were very good. When I took it out of the box, it felt very solid. The case, is as expected from a ThinkPad, very rigid and doesn&rsquo;t bend or twist. The keyboard feels solid.
It has decent key travel and the room between the keys is just perfect for me. The comfort of the keyboard is very important for me since I used to have some RSI symptons in my wrists.
On my desk I type with a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000">Microsoft 4000 keyboard</a>.
That keyboard has provided some solace to my pains, swithing to <a href="http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer Dvorak</a> a few years later made my pains go away, even on laptop keyboards.</p>

<h1>Linux</h1>

<p>This laptop shipped with Windows 8 (yuk!). Since I use <a href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora Linux</a> as my primary OS one of the first thinks I did was installing it.
The initial installation was a breeze, but then some problems sprung to my eye. Suspending to RAM didn&rsquo;t work.
Although the power led started to fade, the fan kept spinning and the system was stuck in this limbo. A second problem arose when I wanted to use the wired network interface. After resuming
from suspend all packets would drop.</p>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>The first issue turned out to be a bug that was introduced after a firmware update. A workaround is to disable USB 3 support in the firmware. Fortunately the two USB 3 ports still function as your
regular old-fashioned USB 2 ports.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find much information on the second issue, so I tried unloading the kernel module driving the interface: <code>sudo modprobe -r r8169</code> before putting my laptop into suspend, and re-inserting it after resume: <code>sudo modprobe r8169</code>. That seemed to fix it, so I wrote a service to unload the module before suspend, and load it after suspend.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was looking for a better password manager. I used to use <a href="http://keepass.info">KeePass</a>, but since I switched to linux as primary OS it has been at least to say annoying using KeePass. KeePass 2 has very nice Firefox integration using the <a href="http://keefox.org/">KeeFox plugin</a>. Unfortunately, KeePass is a .Net application, and even with mono, I could not get it to work. Even opening my database failed since password entering seems to be broken.</p>

<p>Then, I found <a href="http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/">pass</a>. It lives in my shell and has a nice Firefox <a href="https://github.com/jvenant/passff#readme">plugin</a>. Installation was a breeze:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ sudo yum install pass</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It worked, but I missed search functionality. Searching was introduced in version 1.6.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ pass --version
</span><span class='line'>|-----------------------|
</span><span class='line'>|   Password Store      |
</span><span class='line'>|         v.1.4         |
</span><span class='line'>|       by zx2c4        |
</span><span class='line'>|                       |
</span><span class='line'>|    Jason@zx2c4.com    |
</span><span class='line'>|  Jason A. Donenfeld   |
</span><span class='line'>|-----------------------|
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It turns out that I am running an older version. Pass 1.6 requires version 1.7 of tree. That version is unavailable from the Fedora 20 repos, but it is available in rawhide. Switching to rawhide on a workstation is generally a bad idea, so I grabbed the rpm from the rawhide repos:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ wget http://mirror.1000mbps.com/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/x86_64/os/Packages/t/tree-1.7.0-1.fc21.x86_64.rpm
</span><span class='line'>$ sudo yum localinstall tree-1.7.0-1.fc21.x86_64.rpm -y</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, grab pass version 1.6.1 from zx2c4&rsquo;s website and install it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ wget http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/snapshot/password-store-1.6.1.tar.xz
</span><span class='line'>$ tar xf password-store-1.6.1.tar.xz
</span><span class='line'>$ cd password-store-1.6.1
</span><span class='line'>$ sudo make install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There you have it: the latest version of pass on Fedora 20</p>
